# Kodeloftet project site
## Downloading the repo
git clone https://github.com/Bjolav/projects

## Motivation
I wanted to create a project site in order to familiarize myself more with web design as part of the Kodeloftet frontend course.

## Features
Business card, as well as a unit converter and a display of the the parallax effect.

## Build status
This build contains the basics of the features I wanted the site to have.
In future builds I wish to expand on the unit converter and improve its visual design, add more parallax images representing my various interests in addition to adding a main header leading into my them, as well as headers on top of them with the name of said interest. I also wish to add various cards showcasing tools pertaining to my skillset.

## Tech & Frameworks
This site is built using only vanilla html, css and javascript. Other projects using php, react and tailwindcss have yet to be published publically.
